# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

This repository presents the implementation and findings from the published research paper:

**"A Comparative Analysis of the Machine Learning Methods for Predicting Diabetes"**  
ðŸ“Œ *Published in the International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Sustainable Engineering Systems (CISES), Springer.*

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting diabetes using clinical and demographic features.

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Gradient Boosting (GB)
- AdaBoost
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Perceptron
- Decision Tree (DT)
- NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (UCI Repository)
- **Features**: 8 clinical measurements (e.g., glucose level, BMI, age)
- **Target**: Binary outcome (diabetes: yes/no)

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

## ðŸ§ª Key Findings

- Ensemble models such as Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost showed high prediction performance.
- Logistic Regression provided a good balance between interpretability and accuracy.
- Evaluation focused on model reliability and real-world medical application potential.
